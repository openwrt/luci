A WebUI for fast, lightweight DNS-based ad-blocker for OpenWrt that works with dnsmasq, smartdns, or unbound.  
It runs once to process and install blocklists, then exits — keeping memory usage low.

## Features of principal package

- Minimal runtime memory use
- Parallel blocklist download and processing
- Persistent cache support
- Optional Web UI for custom block/allow lists
- Reverts if DNS resolution fails after restart
