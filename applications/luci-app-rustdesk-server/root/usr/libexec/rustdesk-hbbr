#!/usr/bin/env sh
# Wrapper script for hbbr (RustDesk Relay server)
#
# Purpose: This wrapper changes to /etc/rustdesk before exec'ing hbbr.
# This is for consistency with hbbs (which needs the working directory
# for key generation). Using exec ensures the process name remains
# "hbbr" (not "sh") so syslog filtering works correctly.

cd /etc/rustdesk
exec /usr/bin/hbbr "$@"
