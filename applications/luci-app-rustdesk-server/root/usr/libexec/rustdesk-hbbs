# Wrapper script for hbbs (RustDesk ID/Rendezvous server)
#
# Purpose: This wrapper changes to /etc/rustdesk before exec'ing hbbs.
# hbbs generates its keypair (id_ed25519, id_ed25519.pub) in its
# working directory. Using exec ensures the process name remains
# "hbbs" (not "sh") so syslog filtering works correctly.

cd /etc/rustdesk
exec /usr/bin/hbbs "$@"
